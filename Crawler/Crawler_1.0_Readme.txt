I made the first crawler - Crawler_1.0

It prints all “T20“ the players with their “Batting Stats” of the following countries :-
Australia
Bangladesh
England
India
New Zealand
Pakistan
South Africa
Sri Lanka
West Indies
Zimbabwe

Rest teams would be added in further versions of the crawler.

Do make further changes in another copy of the code to add the bowler stats of the same players. Save the new code as Crawler_1.1

Any major change in the crawler as printing the data to the file, upgrade the version to Crawler_2.0

Also mention comments, what changes has been done in which version to make the current code.
Thanx
